# Introduction to Move and Sui

Move is a programming language designed for writing safe and flexible smart contracts. It was initially developed for the Libra blockchain (now Diem) and is now used in various blockchain platforms like Sui.

## Key Features

- Resource-oriented programming
- Strong guarantees about data safety and security
- Flexibility and reusability of code

## Use Cases

- Asset management
- Decentralized applications (dApps)
- Protocols and standards

## Code Exercise

Write a simple Move module that initializes a greeting and moves it to storage.

```move
module HelloWorld {
    public fun hello() {
        let greeting = "Hello, world!";
        move_to(&greeting);
    }
}
```
