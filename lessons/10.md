# Access Control

This lesson will teach you how to implement access control in Move.

## Key Concepts

- Checking signer identity
- Implementing access control

## Code Exercise

Write a Move module that checks if the caller is the owner before executing further logic.

```move
module AccessControl {
    public fun only_owner(owner: address, signer: &signer) {
        assert!(signer::address_of(signer) == owner, 1);
    }

    public fun main(owner: address, signer: &signer) {
        only_owner(owner, signer);
        // Additional logic here
    }
}
