# Structs and Resources

This lesson will teach you how to define and use structs and resources in Move.

## Key Concepts

- Struct definition
- Resource management

## Code Exercise

Write a Move module that defines a struct and initializes it with a value.

```move
module StructsAndResources {
    struct Coin has key, store {
        value: u64,
    }

    public fun main() {
        let coin = Coin { value: 100 };
        assert!(coin.value == 100, 1);
    }
}
```
