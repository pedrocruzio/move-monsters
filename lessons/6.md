# Vectors

This lesson will teach you how to use vectors in Move to store and manipulate collections of data.

## Key Concepts

- Vector initialization
- Adding and accessing elements in a vector

## Code Exercise

Write a Move module that creates a vector, adds elements to it, and calculates the sum of the elements.

```move
module Vectors {
    public fun main() {
        let mut nums: vector<u64> = vector::empty();
        vector::push_back(&mut nums, 10);
        vector::push_back(&mut nums, 20);
        vector::push_back(&mut nums, 30);
        let sum: u64 = vector::borrow(&nums, 0) + vector::borrow(&nums, 1) + vector::borrow(&nums, 2);
        assert!(sum == 60, 1);
    }
}
