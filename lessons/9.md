# Events

This lesson will teach you how to emit and handle events in Move.

## Key Concepts

- Structs for events
- Emitting events

## Code Exercise

Write a Move module that defines an event and emits it.

```move
module Events {
    struct Event has copy, drop {
        message: String,
    }

    public fun main() {
        let event = Event { message: "Event emitted!" };
        emit(event);
    }
}
